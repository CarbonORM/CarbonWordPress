# CarbonWordpress

A WordPress Plugin to provide a GUI for CarbonPHP. This plugin is in active development and is not ready for public use.

## Download Options

This is a general list of different ways to download the CarbonPHP framework. I've ordered them from least technical to
most technical.

1) ~~Search for CarbonPHP in the WordPress plugin store.~~ (Pending review)
2) Download the latest stable code [directly as a zip](https://github.com/CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
   ) from [GitHub](https://github.com/CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress).

    - Log in to your WordPress account.
    - In the left-side menu, navigate to "Plugins" and click on it.
    - Choose the "Add New" option.
    - Click on the "Upload Plugin" button.
    - Select the "Choose File" button.
    - Locate and pick the plugin's .zip file stored on your local computer.
    - Click "Open."
    - To commence the installation, click on "Install Now."
3) Clone the repository from GitHub (HTTPS or SSH) into your plugin's directory (typically `wp-content/plugins`).
    - Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.
    - In the left-hand menu, click on "Plugins."
    - You will see a list of all your installed plugins. Find the plugin you want to activate.
    - Under the plugin CarbonWordpress, you should see an "Activate" link. Click on "Activate."
    - The plugin will now be activated, and you should see a confirmation message indicating that the plugin has been
      successfully activated.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress.git
```

It is `recommended to use SSH version below` if you have it [set up](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account). This will allow you to push changes to your own fork
of the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress.git
```
