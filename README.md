# CarbonWordpress
A WordPress Plugin to provide a GUI for CarbonPHP. 



## Download Options

This is a general list of different ways to download the CarbonPHP framework. I've ordered them from least technical to 
most technical.

1) Search for CarbonPHP in the WordPress plugin store.
2) Download the latest stable code as a zip from [GitHub](https://github.com/CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress).
3) Clone the repository from GitHub (HTTPS or SSH).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress.git
```
It is recommended to use SSH version below if you have it set up. This will allow you to push changes to your own fork 
of the repository.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress.git
```
