# CarbonWordpress

A WordPress Plugin to provide a GUI for CarbonPHP.

## Download Options

This is a general list of different ways to download the CarbonPHP framework. I've ordered them from least technical to
most technical.

1) Search for CarbonPHP in the WordPress plugin store.
2) Download the latest stable code as a zip from [GitHub](https://github.com/CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress).
    - Log in to your WordPress account.
    - In the left-side menu, navigate to "Plugins" and click on it.
    - Choose the "Add New" option.
    - Click on the "Upload Plugin" button.
    - Select the "Choose File" button.
    - Locate and pick the plugin's .zip file stored on your local computer.
    - Click "Open."
    - To commence the installation, click on "Install Now."
3) Clone the repository from GitHub (HTTPS or SSH) into your plugins directory.
    - Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.
    - In the left-hand menu, click on "Plugins."
    - You will see a list of all your installed plugins. Find the plugin you want to activate.
    - Under the plugin CarbonWordpress, you should see an "Activate" link. Click on "Activate."
    - The plugin will now be activated, and you should see a confirmation message indicating that the plugin has been
      successfully activated.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress.git
```

It is recommended to use SSH version below if you have it set up. This will allow you to push changes to your own fork
of the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress.git
```
