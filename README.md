# CarbonWordpress

A WordPress Plugin to provide a GUI for CarbonPHP. **This plugin** is in **active development** and is **not ready for public use**.

## Download Options

This is a general list of different ways to download the CarbonPHP framework. I've ordered them from IMO least technical to
most technical.

1) ~~Search for CarbonPHP in the WordPress plugin store.~~ (Pending review)
2) Download the latest stable code [directly as a zip](https://github.com/CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
   ) from [GitHub](https://github.com/CarbonORM/CarbonWordPress).
